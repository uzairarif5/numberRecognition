# numberRecognition (Python 3.8.3)
This is a neural network that will try to identify the numbers you draw.

Open the python file using command prompt, thats where the output will be displayed. When you execute the python file, there will be a window where you can draw a number. Click the 'check' button to submit your number, and click the 'clear' button to clear your drawing board.

Modules used:
- numpy
- tkinter
- math
- os
- threading


However, the neural network has not been trained with alot of data, the purpose of this project was to get the basic understanding of how to program a neural network in Python.
